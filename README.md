## Introduction
Welcome to the EdTech Platform, a full stack educational technology application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This platform provides a comprehensive solution for online education, enabling educators to create and manage courses, and allowing students to enroll in and complete courses.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using JWT.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Different access levels for administrators, educators, and students.
- **Course Management:** Create, update, delete, and view courses.
- **Lesson Management:** Add, edit, delete, and view lessons within courses.
- **Enrollment:** Students can enroll in courses and track their progress.
- **Interactive Quizzes:** Integrated quizzes for assessing student knowledge.
- **Discussion Forums:** Enable communication between students and educators.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

  - React
  - Redux (for state management)
  - React Router (for navigation)
  - Axios (for API calls)
  - Bootstrap (for styling)

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (Mongoose for ORM)
  - JWT (for authentication)

- **Development Tools:**
  - Webpack (module bundler)
  - Babel (JavaScript compiler)
  - ESLint (code linting)
  - Prettier (code formatting)
  - Jest (testing framework)
  - Docker (containerization)
